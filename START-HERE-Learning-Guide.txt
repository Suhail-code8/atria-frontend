===============================================================================

Hi! This guide will help you understand your Atria Event Management code using 
Gemini AI. Follow these steps:

===============================================================================
STEP 1: OPEN GEMINI
===============================================================================

Go to: https://gemini.google.com

===============================================================================
STEP 2: START WITH THE BASICS (Recommended Order)
===============================================================================

Copy and paste these prompts ONE AT A TIME into Gemini:

---[ PROMPT 1: TypeScript Basics ]---

I'm learning TypeScript and need to understand the basics. Please explain:

1. What is TypeScript and how is it different from JavaScript?
2. What are types, interfaces, and type annotations?
3. Explain these TypeScript features with examples:
   - Basic types (string, number, boolean, array)
   - Interfaces
   - Type aliases
   - Enums
   - Generics
   - Optional properties (?)
   - Union types (|)

Please use simple examples and explain like I'm a beginner.

---[ PROMPT 2: React Basics ]---

I'm building a React application. Please explain:

1. What is React and how does it work?
2. What are components, props, and state?
3. What is the difference between functional and class components?
4. What are React Hooks and why do we use them?
5. Explain these hooks with examples:
   - useState
   - useEffect
   - useNavigate (from react-router-dom)

Keep explanations beginner-friendly with code examples.

---[ PROMPT 3: Understanding Forms in React ]---

I have forms in my React app. Please explain:

1. How to handle form inputs in React?
2. What is controlled vs uncontrolled components?
3. How to handle form submission?
4. How to manage multiple form fields with one state object?
5. How to handle different input types (text, checkbox, select)?

Show me a complete example of a form with multiple field types.

===============================================================================
STEP 3: UNDERSTAND YOUR SPECIFIC CODE
===============================================================================

Now that you know the basics, let's understand YOUR code!

---[ PROMPT 4: Understanding Your Event Model ]---

I have this Event model in my code. Please explain every part:

[PASTE THE CONTENT FROM: event-creation-code.txt - Event Model section]

Specifically explain:
1. What is each field for?
2. What do the enums (EventType, EventStatus) do?
3. What are the capabilities and how do they work?
4. What is the registrationForm array?
5. How does the schema validation work?

---[ PROMPT 5: Understanding Event Creation ]---

I want to understand how event creation works in my app. Here's the code:

[PASTE THE CONTENT FROM: event-creation-code.txt - CreateEvent Component section]

Please explain:
1. How does the form state management work?
2. What happens when I submit the form?
3. How do capabilities get toggled?
4. How are dates handled?
5. What is the flow from form submission to database?

Walk me through the entire process step-by-step.

---[ PROMPT 6: Understanding Event Lifecycle ]---

My app has an event lifecycle system. Here's the code:

[PASTE THE CONTENT FROM: event-creation-code.txt - Event Lifecycle section]

Please explain:
1. What is a state machine/lifecycle?
2. How do the transition rules work?
3. What are preconditions and why are they needed?
4. How does the validation prevent invalid transitions?
5. Give me examples of valid and invalid transitions.

Explain like I'm learning about state management for the first time.

===============================================================================
STEP 4: UNDERSTAND THE COMPLETE SYSTEM
===============================================================================

---[ PROMPT 7: Complete System Overview ]---

I want to understand my entire event management system. Here's what I have:

FRONTEND:
- CreateEvent component (creates events)
- EventManagement component (manages events)
- EventList component (displays events)
- Event API client (communicates with backend)

BACKEND:
- Event Model (database schema)
- Event Controller (handles requests)
- Event Service (business logic)
- Event Lifecycle (state transitions)
- Event Routes (API endpoints)

Please explain:
1. How do all these pieces work together?
2. What is the flow from user clicking "Create Event" to event being saved?
3. What is the flow for transitioning event states?
4. How does data flow between frontend and backend?
5. What are the key concepts I need to understand?

Create a step-by-step guide showing how everything connects.

===============================================================================
STEP 5: WHEN YOU GET STUCK
===============================================================================

Use this template for ANY question:

---[ CUSTOM QUESTION TEMPLATE ]---

I'm working on [describe what you're trying to do] and need to understand 
[specific concept or code].

Here's my current code:
[Paste the specific code you're confused about]

Please explain:
1. What is this code doing?
2. Why is it written this way?
3. How would I modify it for [your specific use case]?

Use simple language and examples.

===============================================================================
HELPFUL TIPS
===============================================================================

✅ DO:
- Ask one question at a time
- Copy the EXACT prompt text
- Paste your actual code when asked
